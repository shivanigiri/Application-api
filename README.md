# Application-api

1) Made a bare skeleton spring project with no dependencies. 
2) Explained importance of parent element in Maven and the motivation behind its existence
3) Spring focuses more on the business logic/conventions rather than configurations . this is the motivation^^
4) our project is a child of the parent maven project, and any configuration in the parent project will be inherited by the child project. 
5)  spring-boot-starter-web dependency is a dependency which contains all the jars that we normally need for each and every web application
6) use the property element to change the version of the JRE system library being used
